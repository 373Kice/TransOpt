# TransOpt
The package TransOpt makes it possible for VASP users to calculate electrical transport properties (Seebeck coefficients, electrical conductivities, and electronic thermal conductivities) by using (1) the momentum matrix method (Method 1) or (2) derivative method same as adopted in BoltzTrap (Method 2).
